# Unicorn_companies
This project focused on Unicorn Companies, with a valuation over $1 billion. This project involves analyzing the dataset to answer questions such as:
1. Which companies have had the biggest return on investment.
2. How long it takes for a company to become a unicorn 
3. Which countries have the most unicorns.
4. Which investors have funded the most unicorns.
The goal of the project is to come up with at least four data-driven recommendations to help Unicorn Companies create good business models and make decisions that prioritize companies with high growth potential, diversify their investment portfolio and prioritize companies with experienced leadership teams.
